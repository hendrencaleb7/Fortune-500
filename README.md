This project aimed to create a dashboard that accurately depicted trends and demographics within the Fortune 500. The dataset used is from kaggle.com, below is a link. 
There are over 14,000 rows and 16 columns of data, I purposely chose such a large dataset to push the boundary of my abilities. 
I had use techniques unfamiliar to me, such as displaying nearly 1000 records of data with one chart and two filters using a parallel coordinate plot.

Posted to my Github are the original data, cleaned data, my SQL code, and the Excel sheets used in Tableau.
